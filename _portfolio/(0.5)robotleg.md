I worked on the design, manufacturing, software, and control of several individual robot legs for the NASA funded LASSIE project, that are used as in-situ rheometers (essentially highly precise soil strength measurement devices). The single leg that I manufactured, would be attached to a larger, four legged robot to be used for exploration on other planets. The individual leg is used to observe how a single leg reacts to penetrating various ground materials. Experiments we conducted have found that by observing the forces that the leg experiences as it interacts with a granular surface, it is possible to get an idea of the rheology and material properties that a legged robot is walking on with every step that it takes, providing much higher density of information about the surface of an unknown planet than ever before.

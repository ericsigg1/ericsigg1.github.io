In summer 2022 and 2023, I collaborated with a team of roboticists and geologists to deploy two robotic boats having a sensor suite on the Schuylkill river. The robots were able to, using RTK GPS, autonomously navigate the river, collaboratively collecting data on bathymetry, pH, temperature, salinity, and turbidity.

Part of this work involved the development of a winch system for one of the boats. The winch system was capable of raising and lowering a sensor suite, with which our team was able to gain high density 3D data (in depth, and position on the surface the river) on river bathymetry, pH, temperature, salinity, and turbidity.

I spent the summer of 2025 developing a sensor payload for the LASSIE quadrupedal explorer robot at NASA JSC. Using a set of depth cameras, the robot is able to percieve its environment, and in conjuction with feedback force sensing of the legs, characterize terrain strength, finding safe paths for astronauts to walk and for wheeled rovers to drive without becoming stuck in loose terrain. The payload consists of several cameras, all of which are stereo cameras, such that they can percieve depth.

I got to test this in White Sands National Park in New Mexico, which we chose as a lunar analog environment. There, we characterized terrain strength and using the cameras were able to create a 3d map of our environment, colocating terrain strength measurements with terrain and robot footprint images.
